# frenchdict
Command-Line Application for French-English Translations

## Introduction
This application is an exercise for me on structuring Python repos and writing a project from start to finish.

If you have any suggestions on how this repo might be improved, I'd love to hear them!

## Requirements
There's no `requirements.txt` in this repo because you pretty much don't need any special packages to run this thing. Just plain old Python should do. I'm using Python 3.12.3.

## How to Run
I haven't packaged the application yet. The application runs from `french_dict/core.py`.

I've only tested on Windows, but I see no reason why this shouldn't work on Linux or Mac as well.

## Dictionary Source
The dictionary file included in `docs/` is a pared down version of the dictionary from [kaikki.org](https://kaikki.org/dictionary/French/index.html).
